## 📂 Project Structure

To keep the repository clean and easy to navigate, files are grouped into logical folders:

- 📘 **Notebook** →  
  [`student_performance_ml_project.ipynb`](student-performance-ml-project/notebook/student_performance_ml_project.ipynb)
- 📊 **Results** (evaluation tables, model comparisons) →  
  [`results/`](student-performance-ml-project/results/)
- 📈 **Plots** (all visualizations: heatmap, PCA, model comparison, etc.) →  
  [`plots/`](student-performance-ml-project/plots/)
- 📄 **Predictions** (CSV predictions from each model) →  
  [`predictions/`](student-performance-ml-project/predictions/)
- 🗂 **Raw Data** (original dataset split into features & target) →  
  [`data_raw/`](student-performance-ml-project/data_raw/)
- 🧮 **Processed Data** (scaled data, PCA outputs, train/test splits) →  
  [`data_processed/`](student-performance-ml-project/data_processed/)
- 🔧 **Models & Encoders** (saved scaler and label encoder .pkl files) →  
  [`models/`](student-performance-ml-project/models/)
- 📦 **All Outputs ZIP** →  
  [`student_performance_project_outputs.zip`](student-performance-ml-project/student_performance_project_outputs.zip)

## 📈 Visualizations Included

- Heatmap of correlations  
- PCA explained variance plot  
- Actual vs Predicted (best model)  
- Model comparison bar chart  
- Error distribution plot  

All available inside the `plots/` folder.

## 📊 Results Summary

After evaluating all models across MSE and R² metrics, the **Stacking Regressor (Sklearn)** delivered the best overall performance.

### ⭐ Best Model: Stacking Regressor (Sklearn)
- **Highest R² Score** (~0.90 depending on run)
- **Lowest Mean Squared Error**
- **Most stable and consistent predictions**

### 🔍 Key Insights from Model Comparison
- **Boosting models** (Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost) performed significantly better than single weak learners.
- **Regularized Linear Models** (Ridge & Lasso) showed improvement over standard Linear Regression.
- **From-Scratch Models** (kNN, Linear Regression, SVR) closely matched sklearn performance, validating correctness.
- **PCA** reduced dimensionality while maintaining predictive power, improving model stability.

Detailed metrics for all models are available in the [`results/`](results/) directory.  
Visual comparisons (bar charts, error distributions, predictions vs actual) are in [`plots/`](plots/).

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Set up the environment
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```
install all requiered dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2️⃣ Run the notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook notebook/student_performance_ml_project.ipynb
```
### 3️⃣ Project File Paths (auto-recognized)

The notebook automatically loads and saves files in the following folders:

- **data_raw/** — raw dataset  
- **data_processed/** — scaled data, PCA outputs  
- **plots/** — all visualizations and graphs  
- **predictions/** — model prediction CSVs  
- **results/** — evaluation metrics, comparison tables  
- **models/** — encoders, scaler, and saved preprocessing objects  

No manual path changes are required.

### 4️⃣ (Optional) Reproduce Everything Automatically

If you have **papermill** installed, you can regenerate all results, plots, and outputs with a single command:

```bash
./run_all.sh
```
This will create a fully executed notebook at: 
```bash
notebook/executed_student_performance.ipynb 
```

---

### 5️⃣ (Optional) Run in Google Colab

1. Open Google Colab  
2. Upload the main notebook: **notebook/student_performance_ml_project.ipynb**  
3. Upload the **data_raw/** folder (or mount Google Drive)  
4. Run all cells  

All other folders (`data_processed`, `plots`, `models`, etc.) will be created automatically by the notebook.
